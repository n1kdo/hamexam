# HamExam Source Code

From 1994, 1995, KD1LZ and I wrote and sold this Windows-based software.

The software let a user practice for amateur radio examinations.

The question pools are quite out-of-date at this time, this is not useful

the content, but also for the construction.  You don't see a lot of Win32
code these days.
